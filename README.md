# Character_Sheets_COTRQ

This repository contains python files to generate Character Sheets for all of our campaign characters.

You can update your own character file when you level up, or add more descriptive text. If you like, you can then also use the included code to generate your own new Character Sheet PDF, or just rely on me to do it.

To install the `dungeon_sheets` code:
```
make install
```
To regenerate your own character:
```
make celadin
```
to regenerate all:
```
make all
```
